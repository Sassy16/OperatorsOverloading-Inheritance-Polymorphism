<u>Shape</u> - An abstract class. a shape has a name (String), center (Point), and the amount of shaped that has been created (static variable).
Quad - respresnts a quad and has 4 edges lengths (up, down, left, right)
Square - represents a square and has no additional data members.
Circle - represnts a circle with a radius.

In the AllShapes class we have a polymorpic array of all the shapes and the size of the array.
